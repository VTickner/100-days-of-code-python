# Beginner

## Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

### Project requirements:

1. Create a greeting for your program.
2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in and store it in a variable.
3. Ask the user for the name of a pet and store it in a variable.
4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line:

### Code & Potential Improvements:

- Solution URL: [Day 1 - Band Name Generator](./beginner/day1_band_name_generator.py)
- I used `while True:` and `if` statements to check whether an empty string had been entered for the city and pet names and if so to request the input again from the user.
